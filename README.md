# Mod Previews

This mod adds preview images to mods in Geode! 

If a mod developer adds preview images to their repo, they will show up when you look at the mod. 

As a mod developer, create a `previews` folder at the root of your mod's repo. Within that folder, you can put up to 10 preview images following the name `preview-#.png` for 1-10. For example `previews/preview-1.png`.
